/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<pre>Review: ham delivered the opinion of the court it is said in 116 that writ of conspiracy for indicting for felony doth not lie but against two persons the and that both or neither must be found but writ of conspiracy for indicting one of trespass or other falsity lieth against one person only and it appears from many adjudged cases that an action on the case in the nature of conspiracy will lie against one or if brought against many all may be acquitted but one so that it is no good objection to this action that one has been acquitted and the other found guilty chitty’s pleadings if several persons be made defendants jointly where the tort in point of law could not be joint they may demur and if verdict bo taken against all the judgment may be arrested or reversed on writ of error —in this case the declaration charges both defendants with that of which one only can be guilty viz that the land was not advertised in the most public place in the county for forty days this is charge that can only be made against the sheriff whose official duty it was so to advertise it and in case ver diet had been taken against both advantage might be taken of it in either of the ways pointed out but verdict has been taken against the sheriff only and the other acquitted which does away the objection ibid as in an action against husband and wife for that they spoke of the plaintiff certain scandalous words the jury found the husband guilty and the wife not guilty the plaintiff shall have judgment for tho’ the action ought not to be both and therefore if the defendant had demurred to the declaration it would have been bad yet the verdict hath cured this error ‡ indeed if the in j the case had found both defendants guilty the plaintiff might have entered nolle prosequi against garland and taken judgment against the § whether pi the charge of the court was right or westbrook has no right to wrong it was only so as to garland who has now no to complain as the jury have acquitted him think new trial ought riot to be granted saun 230 note vol 1st 74 roll abr 781 str 349 saun 117 note wils 306 saun 207 
Original summary: an action in the nature of writ of against two persons and one be ac found guilty up against that acquittal of t he ground for the judg 
Predicted summary:  1 appeal and error where the record on appeal is not docketed in the supreme court and the judgment of the lower court will be affirmed without becoming precedent


Review: campbell judge the defendant assigns as error that he did not receive sentence the same as the sentence imposed upon one of the co conspirators there is no merit in this assignment of error state garris 265 n c 711 144 s e 2d 901 1965 we have reviewed the record in this case and find no prejudicial error no error judges britt and hedrick concur 
Original summary: criminal law 138— sentence of defendant different than sentence of co conspirator the fact that defendant did not receive the same sentence as that received by one of his co conspirators is not ground for legal objection 
Predicted summary:  criminal law 155 5— failure to docket record on appeal in apt time appeal is dismissed for failure to docket the record on appeal within the time allowed by the court of appeals rule 5


Review: pee cueiam tbe controversy between tbe parties in this action narrowed itself on tbe trial to questions of fact which tbe jury have answered in favor of tbe defendant we have carefully examined tbe record and find no sufficient reason for disturbing tbe verdict technically under tbe pleadings plaintiff may not have been entitled to judgment for tbe 20 but this is not tbe basis of bis appeal apparently be has been according to bis own agreement his honor below evidently took this view of tbe matter and we think tbe plaintiff should be content with tbe result no error 
Original summary: appeal and error issues of fact error held only issues of fact were involved on this appeal and the judgment as to amount of plaintiff’s damages was not the basis of his appeal being apparently according to his own agreement and no error is found 
Predicted summary:  1 appeal and error 19— an assignment of error to the signing of the judgment presents the question of whether the facts found support the judgment and the judgment will be affirmed


Review: this case was argued with that of the commissioners of granville against the same defendant the ground of objection to the act of 1872 73 insisted on in this case is that by the of part of the territory and population of granville the security of the plaintiff who is creditor of that county will be impaired or altered this objection can only be derived from an idea that creditor merely as such has some sort of lien on the property of his debtor so that he cannot honestly part with any of it under any circumstances as long as the debt is unpaid the moment it is put in this shape the objection is seen to be untenable in the case of an individual debtor he can sell his property provided it be not done with fraudulent intent and even in that case the conveyance is good as to him though void as to his creditors in this case the suspicion of any such intent even if otherwise it could be entertained is rebutted by the provision in the act that franklin as between it and gran ville shall assume just part of the debt of granville while as to the creditor granville remains liable for the whole this objection is novel although if it had force it might often have been made before in similar cases per curiam the judgment of the superior court dissolving the injunction affirmed and action dismissed 
Original summary: the act of 1872 chap 143 changing the dividing lines between the counties of granville and franklin and thereby adding portion of the territory of the former to the latter county is not unconstitutional and the carrying out of its provisions cannot be enjoined at the instance of creditor on behalf of himself and the other creditors of the former county 
Predicted summary:  1 appeal and error where the record on appeal is not docketed in the supreme court and the judgment of the lower court will be affirmed without becoming precedent


Review: parker judge judgment the cause of action upon which it was rendered and becomes itself the obligation ” mcintosh practice and procedure 2d therefore plaintiff’s original cause of action in which he sought recovery of damages for injuries to his property allegedly caused by defendants’ negligence became merged into the consent judgment dated january 1973 where judgment directs party to perform specific act and the party fails to comply within the time specified various methods by which enforcement of the judgment may be effected are set forth in g s 1a 1 rule 70 this rule provides in part as follows “if judgment directs party to execute conveyance of land or to deliver deeds or other documents or to perform any other specific act and the party fails to comply within the time specified the judge may direct the act to be done at the cost of the disobedient party by some other person appointed by the judge and the act when so done has like effect as if done by the party on application of the party entitled to performance the clerk shall issue writ of attachment or sequestration against the property of the disobedient party to compel obedience to the judgment the judge may also in proper cases adjudge the party in contempt ” 295 in the present case none of the procedures provided for in rule 70 was followed plaintiff did ask in his motion “that the defendants be held in contempt of court but plaintiff failed to show and the court made no finding that defendants’ default in complying with the consent judgment was the result of willful disobedience such finding is required before punishment may be imposed in civil contempt proceedings mauney mauney 268 n c 254 150 s e 2d 391 and even then the trial judge in this state has no authority to award indemnifying fines or other compensation to private party in contempt proceeding records tape corp and broadcasting system tape corp 18 n c app 183 196 s e 2d 598 we hold that it was error for the trial court to enter the judgment awarding plaintiff monetary damages under the procedures disclosed by the present record resort should be had to other procedures which may include one or more of those provided for in rule 70 to obtain in this action defendants’ compliance with the obligation imposed upon them by the consent judgment of january 1973 the judgment appealed from is vacated and this is remanded to the superior court of forsyth county for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith vacated and remanded chief judge brock and judge morris concur 
Original summary: 1 judgments 10 rules of civil procedure 70 consent judgment original cause of action enforcement of judgment plaintiff’s original cause of action for damages for injuries to his house trailer allegedly caused by defendants’ negligence became merged into consent judgment entered by the parties and enforcement of the judgment upon defendants’ failure to comply within the time specified could be effected through various methods set forth in g s 1a 1 rule 70 contempt of court judgments 10 noncompliance with consent judgment punishment for contempt though plaintiff did ask that defendants be held in contempt of court for failure to comply with consent judgment plaintiff did not show and the court did not make the required finding that defendants’ default was the result of willful disobedience furthermore had such finding been made the trial judge had no authority to award an fine or other compensation to private party in contempt proceeding judgments 10 rules of civil procedure 70 noncompliance with consent judgment award of monetary damages error where defendants failed to comply with consent judgment requiring them to repair all damage to plaintiff’s trailer and plaintiff filed verified motion in the cause alleging defendants’ noncompliance and alleging that for repair of the damage could not be had for less than the trial court erred in awarding plaintiff monetary damages of since none of the procedures for enforcement of the judgment provided for in rule 70 were followed

Review: seawell on motion to strike out the test of relevancy of pleading is the right of the pleader to present the facts to which the allegation relates in the evidence upon the trial pemberton greensboro 203 514 515 166 396 patterson ante 38 43 if the defense provided in chapter 275 public laws 1933 is available to the defendants in this case they are entitled to introduce evidence of the facts constituting such defense on the trial at this juncture of the case we are not able to agree with the plaintiff that the suggested defense is not available to defendants as executors of the guarantor of the notes upon which this suit is brought it might be contended with reason that proper construction of the statute should regard the act of mortgagee or trustee or holder of the notes secured by the mortgage in acquiring the mortgaged premises at foreclosure sale had at its instigation and for its benefit as an act going to the discharge of the instrument and giving to the guarantor the benefit of this defense under the negotiable instruments law 3101 it would not be an unreasonable interpretation of the statute to hold that it proceeds upon the equitable assumption that the debtor has received payment in full when by his own choice he takes the land and that the purpose of the law is under such circumstances to discharge the debt is not of course for us to say whether the defendants can make good the allegations of their further defense we only say that at this stage of the ease we do not deny their right to make it we are not sure of plaintiff’s right to appeal on this matter under 638 since the same question could have been raised on objections to the evidence and if necessary reviewed on appeal from the final judgment and it does not now appear that any substantial right has been affected pemberton greensboro supra but since the holding is adverse to plaintiff’s contention and the appeal has precedent we prefer to decide the matter upon the merits the judgment denying the plaintiff’s motion is affirmed 
Original summary: 1 pleadings 29— on motion to strike out tlie test is whether the pleader would be entitled to introduce evidence in support of the allegations sought to be stricken mortgages 36 defense that property was worth debt at time it was bid in by cestui is available to guarantor on note this action by the cestui que trust to recover the balance due on the note secured by the instrument after foreclosure and the application of the proceeds of sale to the note was instituted against the personal representatives of the guarantor of payment on the note defendants alleged as further defense that the property was bid in by of the cestui for the benefit of the cestui and that at the time the value of the property exceeded the amount of the debt ch 275 public laws of 1933 michie’s code plaintiff moved to strike out the further defense meld defendants were entitled to make the defense and the motion to strike out was properly denied appeal and error 2— whether the denial of motion to strike out is appealable under qucere since the same question may be presented by objections to the evidence and determined upon review of the final judgment 
Predicted summary:  1 criminal law §§ 34 criminal law §§ 34 criminal law §§ 23 appeal from conviction of guilty plea of guilty plea of guilty of felonious breaking and entering and larceny is not sufficient to support plea of guilty of guilty of felonious breaking and entering and larceny of larceny of intoxicating liquor and the court may not be convicted of the offense charged in the indictment and the warrant is fatally defective and the court may not thereafter enter into the plea of guilty of the offense charged the defendant with the felonious breaking and entering and larceny of the offense charged in the indictment


Review: clark judge in oral argument before this court is was stipulated by counsel that the purpose of the taking was for an overhead transmission line referred to in the resolution of petitioner as conductor lines ” but this does not relieve the necessity for declaration of whether the petitioner is taking an easement or fee in this proceeding the statute under which this condemnation is brought chapter 1032 session laws of 1959 requires that the condemnation resolution include the interest to be taken and purpose of the taking the resolution is ambiguous once referring to an and otherwise referring to “land ” in elec gas co 251 s c 138 161 s e 2d 163 1968 condemnation of “land” was held to be of an easement because that was all that was needed for public purpose the judgment is reversed and this cause is remanded to the superior court of guilford county with direction that it remand to petitioner for adoption of resolution in compliance with chapter 1032 session laws of 1959 stating clearly the public purpose for the taking and the interest sought to be taken reversed and remanded chief judge brock and judge hedrick concur 
Original summary: eminent domain 7— condemnation resolution interest to be taken ambiguity trial court erred in entering partial summary judgment and ordering the matter submitted to jury for ascertainment of damages for the taking of fee where the resolution of petitioner was ambiguous as to whether the petitioner was taking an easement or fee in this proceeding 
Predicted summary:  1 criminal law §§ 34 166— failure to docket record on appeal in apt time appeal is dismissed for failure to docket the record on appeal within 90 days after the date of the judgment appealed from the judgment of the court of appeals rule 5


Review: hedrick judge defendant contends in his only assignment of error that the district court erred in awarding alimony pendente lite without finding that plaintiff lacked sufficient means to subsist during the prosecution of this action he concedes that if the order was final order awarding permanent alimony it was not erroneous the case thus hinges on whether the order was final or interlocutory defendant argues that it was pendente lite order because it did not dispose of plaintiff’s claims for medical expenses her share of the joint bank account and damages for assault we do not agree while the order does not recite whether it is final or interlocutory it seems clear that it is final order because after making detailed findings and conclusions the court awarded the plaintiff divorce from bed and board which is final order g s 50 7 there is no such thing as divorce from and board pendente lite the district court simply determined that plaintiff was not entitled to those forms of relief not mentioned in its order affirmed judges parker and clark concur 
Original summary: divorce and alimony 17— alimony divorce from bed and board final order trial court’s order granting plaintiff divorce from bed and board and awarding plaintiff alimony was final order notwithstanding the order did not dispose of plaintiff’s claims for medical expenses her share of joint bank account and damages for assault it was therefore unnecessary for the court to find that plaintiff lacked sufficient means to subsist during prosecution of the action

Review: pearson we concur with his honor in respect to the power of the court upon the question of costs it is true that the probate of will is “a proceeding in rem and no one although to hear proceedings is obliged to make himself party yet when the persons interested make themselves parties for or against the alleged will and an issue is made up it is to be tried and determined like all other issues and there is no provision in our statute which distinguishes the proceeding from that of any other matter at common law as distinguished from proceeding in equity it is admitted that in equity there is broad discretion on the subject of costs but in this which as we have seen is proceeding at common law the statute gives no discretion and provides that the costs shall abide the decision of the cause so the court can render no other judgment than that the successful party recover of the other party his costs the fund that is the assets of the estate is not in court so as to be under its control the administrator of the deceased is no party to this proceeding then can the court enter judgment against him for the costs of proceeding to which ho was not party and in be bad no opportunity of being beard in respect to tbe question of costs or any thing else oubiam judgment affirmed

Review: chief justice delivered the opinion of the court this case turns upon the interpretation of certain words introduced into the act of 1800 concerning horse racing the words of the act are that all horse ing contracts shall be reduced to writing and signed by the parties thereto at the time they are made ” do these words signify that race shall not be made by parol on one day and the writings executed on another or do they import that the contract shall not he written on one day and signed by the parties on subsequent day that the latter is their true and rational construction is evident from the context and the subsequent part of the clause for contract cannot be signed until it is written and therefore it is not made until it is reduced to writing what passes between the parties in before the contract is written is carefully kept out of view by the act itself which excludes parol evidence to alter or explain but if the written contract js get side because the parties talked about the race before or even made the race before it must be done by parol evidence of that fact which be in the face of the act no possible mischief can arise from the parties making race at one time if they afterwards deliberately put the terms on paper and sign them at the same time but if there be any length of interval between the writing and signing of the contract man might entrapped by hastily putting his name to contract the terms of which might have escaped his recollection it was this inconvenience the legislature meant to guard against and not to destroy written contract because it had been preceded by discussion and argument as to the terms for such method is calculated to prevent surprise and misapprehension if however it could be shown by any that the written articles do not form the contract contemplated iby the legislature but that the race is the contract what is the consequence it is declared to be void but it was already nullity being extinguished by the subsequent specialty so that whichever way it be taken the party has right to recover 
Original summary: the act of respecting contracts declares that all such contracts shall be reduced to and signed by the parties thereto at the time they are made ” under this act race may be made on one day and the articles of the race and the bonds for the money bet may be reduced to and signed by the parties on subsequent day but the contract shall not be reduced to writing on one day and signed by the parties on subsequent day

Review: wells judge the sole issue raised by defendant is whether the trial court erred in ruling that it has personal jurisdiction over defendant defendant argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the court’s findings of fact and conclusion that he has had sufficient minimum contacts with north carolina to establish jurisdiction we disagree the question of personal jurisdiction is controlled by two part test statutory prerequisite must be met and elements of due process must be satisfied the crucial inquiry in applying this test is whether the defendant has had enough minimum contact with the state to satisfy standards of due process and traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice see johnston 50 n c app 274 273 s e 2d 513 1981 and cases cited and discussed therein trial judge made findings of fact which include the following that defendant signed an acknowledgement of paternity and voluntary support agreement for this child on november 22 1974 in forsyth county north carolina that said document was filed in cumberland county north carolina that in february 1975 defendant was found guilty of criminal non support of said plaintiff minor child in cumberland county that in 1976 defendant was found to be in contempt of the criminal order of this court in cumberland county north carolina that defendant has complied with the criminal order of the cumberland county court for the last six years and has made payments for the support of this minor child through the cumberland county clerk of court’s office defendant argues that these findings have no factual basis because the only evidence considered by the trial judge in making these findings was plaintiffs complaint however defendant took no exception to any of the above findings of fact and excepted only to the judge’s conclusion these are more than adequate minimum contacts of the defendant with the state of north carolina and the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice are not offended by hearing the case here and to the judge’s denial of the motion to dismiss findings of fact not excepted to by the defendant are presumed to be supported by the evidence and are binding on appeal 46 n c app 173 264 s e 2d 902 1980 in our opinion the trial court’s findings of fact support the conclusion that defendant’s contacts with north carolina were substantial enough to meet both the statutory requirements of g s 1 75 4 and due process standards defendant’s of infant plaintiff in north carolina and his signing of an acknowledgment of paternity and voluntary support agreement indicate that defendant engaged in some act or conduct by which he may be said to have invoked the benefits and of the law of the forum compare brown brown 47 n c app 323 267 s e 2d 345 1980 the order denying defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is affirmed affirmed judges hedrick and phillips concur

Review: pearson the only question in the case is does the defendant’s discharge in bankruptcy apply to the demand off the plaintiff we think it does the debt to the plaintiff is for the purchase money of ther 250 land this under tbe constitution and tbe statute over tbe homestead and the execution creditor can sell tbe land the homestead to the contrary notwithstanding provided he has an execution under which to sell when he for judgment and execution he is met by the fact the defendant is discharged by decree in bankruptcy which is pleaded in bar of the further prosecution of your action ” how is this met the plaintiff says have lien or something akin to lien as mr gilmer termed it oh the argument which the bankrupt proceedings are bound to respect ” that is the question what is lien —a mortgage is an express lien docketed judgment is a lien by statute and any one wishing to be informed can see for himself by looking at the books of the county but in regard to obligations for the payment of the purchase there is no mode provided by which to give it notoriety if vendor makes deed for the land instead of retaining the title as security it is his folly true when he gets judgment and issues execution the homestead is not in his way in that respect he is better than other creditors but he has acquired no lien no hold on the land suppose the vendee sells the land to one who knows it has not been paid for the purchaser has good title for the can get no judgment against him and judgment against the vendee will not reach property that he has sold so the vendor although he has the notes given for the purchase money has no lien nothing that sticks like mortgage or docketed judgment it follows that the defendant’s discharge in bankruptcy bars the plaintiff’s debt and if he can get no judgment and the homestead is not drawn in question error judgment for defendant per curiam judgment reversed

Review: chief justice the question in this case is whether the sureties for witherspoon late sheriff of wilkes are liable for the taxes of 1820 by virtue of their bond it appears from the record that witherspoon was elected at april session 1821 and that the bond is conditioned for the taxes therein specified for the year 1821 to make the sureties responsible for any other taxes than those would be going beyond the bond but the taxes laid in 1821 were collectable only in 1822 with the exception of the case where persons were about to remove to avoid the tax before that period the sheriff for 1821 had no power to act in that respect and when that time arrived he had resigned the office as he is permitted to do by law — “the respective sheriffs are to proceed after the first day of april iu each and every year to collect the taxes ” set of 1819 rev eh 999 under the true construction of this act the right to collect the taxes does not attach in the sheriff unless he remain in office after the first day of april nor consequently can responsibility attach to bis sureties the consequence of different construction would be to make two different sets of securities liable for the taxes of 1820 viz the sureties of thomas witherspoon who was sheriff for that year and who remained in office until after the first of april 1821 and to whom the tax bills were then delivered and the present defendants sureties of witherspoon by thus remaining in office until the right to collect began thomas witherspoon was bound to settle with the in october 1821 and although out of office invested various to enforce the collection of taxes acts of 1801 ch ch ch 999 tin county court entertained correct opinion of the orderly mode of proceeding for they directed the tax bills to be delivered to the successor of witherspoon because lie was in oilier when the tax became collectable and ¡he bills of 1820 were delivered to thomas witherspoon in office in 1821 the act of 1819 can only mean hat the it then in office shall proceed lo the taxes not any one who had been sheriff during the preceding year for then if there liad been see which shall be selected by confining it to this period much confusion is avoided and though the sheriff should not be re elected or should resign immediately after his election he may proceed nevertheless to the taxes that the public may be secured and his sureties indemnified am therefore of opinion that the judgment appealed from was correct per cuiuam judgment affirmed 
Original summary: by the act of rev who is in office on the 1st day of april in each year is bound for tlie taxes during that year although his term may expire before they can be collected therefore where sheriff was elected after the 1st day of april and in february ensuing he is not liable for the collection of any taxes

Review: mallard c j defendant contends the trial court committed error in the charge in stating stipulation entered into by the state and the defendant on page fourteen of the record the stipulation is set out as follows this point it is stipulated that if mr lutz were present in court he would stipulate that he had administered blood alcohol test on the defendant and that the test showed that the defendant had content of point twenty two 22 alcohol in his blood stream ” the entire portion of the charge of the court excepted to reads “however it has been stipulated by his counsel that the result of that test was point two two 22 percent ” the stipulation as stated by judge fountain was not in the exact words of the stipulation in the record but when read in context the substance is substantially the same the defendant’s contention that the judge committed prejudicial error in stating the stipulation is without merit the only other assignment of error brought forward by the defendant in his brief is that the court committed error in entering the judgment the defendant contends that an active prison sentence although authorized by g s 20 179 is contrary to custom and therefore he is entitled to new trial or at least that the case ought to be remanded and another sentence imposed “in accordance with prevailing custom ” this contention is without merit the determination of what sentence within the limits fixed by the legislature shall be imposed in case is the duty of the trial judge the statute with respect to the imposition of sentences in north carolina upon conviction or plea of guilty of the crime of operating an automobile on the public highways while under the influence of intoxicating liquor is g s 20 179 under this statute maximum sentence of two years may be imposed and therefore sentence of six months in prison is not excessive state lee 247 n c 230 100 s e 2d 372 state morris n c app 262 163 s e 2d 108 state morris no 414 fall session 1968 supreme court filed 21 january 1969 in the trial and sentence there is no error campbell and morris jj concur

Review: with every disposition to support the title of purchasers at sales and to relieve them from the effect of mere non observance of matters of detail by the officers of the law we find ourselves unable to do so in this case because it appears of record that there is no udgment to support the execution under which the sheriff sold the land there could have been none for there was no personal of the deceased against whom judgment could have been rendered according to the mode of procedure in 1831 in order to subject land to the payment of debt there was in the first place judgment against the personal representative fixing the debt the plea of fully administered being admitted or found by the jury and in the second place sci fa setting out the judgment and calling upon the heirs to show cause why execution should not issue against the land which had descended this gives to the heirs day in court in order to make collateral issue” as to the due administration of the personal estate in our case there is “no personal representative no judgment against him to fix the debt no day in court for the heirs to show why execution said judgment” shall not issue to sell the real estate but when the suit abated by reason of the death of william crawford the plaintiff there issued fi fa to make his part of the of the goods and chattels on 210 acres of land then follows sci fa against the heirs to show why the land should not be sold and venditioni exponas under which the land is sold these proceedings are not merely irregular but void and of no effect for the want of judgment against the personal so campbell under whom the defendant claims had no title by power of the sheriff’s sale there is error per cukiam venire de novo

Review: battue the first objection which appears in the defendant’s bill of exceptions is that the record of the proceedings in the suit for the partition of the land of joshua rayner among his heirs at law was admitted on the part of the plaintiff to show that the line was one of the dividing lines between the freeman land claimed by the plaintiff and the rayner land part of which was claimed by the defendant this evidence was received by the court as the of the commissioners who were proved to be now dead as to question of boundary the evidence was clearly admissible as the declarations and acts of the heirs at law of under and of whom the defendant claimed but it may be doubted whether it was properly admitted upon the reason assigned for it because the commissioners may not have known or professed to have known any thing about the dividing line and may have acted and probably did act solely upon the information of those whose land they were dividing as the record was admissible upon ground quite as strong as that upon which it was admitted the defendant has no just cause to complain of it the question about reversing the lines of the deed under which the plaintiff claimed did not arise for any practical purpose and therefore no objection can be founded upon it the real contest between the parties was whether the beginning corner of the plaintiff’s land was at as contended for by him or was at the pine stump as insisted on by the defendant if it were the latter then the locus in quo would not be within the plaintiff’s boundaries and it is manifest that such would be the result whether the lines were run by the courses and distances in direct or reverse order if the former then it was conceded that the defendant’s cleared field was included within the plaintiff’s lines the evidence of the respective parties in relation to these points was fairly submitted by his honor to the jury and we cannot discover any error in his charge the testimony introduced to show how the lines would run from each of the proposed starting points to wit the letter and the pine stump as delineated on the plat was clearly proper for the purpose of locating the land claimed by the plaintiff and the argument was fair one that if begun and run as contended for by the plaintiff the lines would not interfere with the established boundaries of other adjacent tracts but that it would be otherwise if commenced and run as insisted on by the defendant defendant having been unable to sustain any of his objections to the judgment it must be affirmed per curiam judgment affirmed 
Original summary: where the instructions given by the court could not in any degree prejudice the cause of the even if erroneous it is no ground for venire de novo the fact that particular line was run by commissioners appointed to divide tract of land among tenants in common under an order in an ex parte proceeding is evidence against them and all claiming under them to prove that that is the true line of such tract being the act of the parties themselves it is competent to prove that line run in particular way will disturb and conflict with ancient and well established boundaries of other tracts in order to repel the conclusion that it is the true boundary of the land in question

Review: eagles judge we first consider whether the trial court erred in dismissing the amended complaint on the grounds that calvert insurance company an excess insurer royal asserts that the trial court erred in from the face of the pleadings by considering oral representations regarding the terms of calvert’s liability policy with respect to an alleged 100 000 self insured retention endorsement royal also argues that the motion to add calvert as necessary party which alleged that calvert insured the rental vehicle “for claims in excess of 100 000 00 should not be considered because it was beyond the face of the complaint and amended complaint royal maintains that the trial court could not have made correct conclusion of law regarding the meaning of the calvert policy without examining the contents and language of the policy royal concludes that since no copy of the policy was entered into the record the judge apparently relied upon counsel’s oral representations as to the terms and conditions of that policy calvert argues that the court properly considered that calvert was an excess insurer because the motion to add calvert as necessary party was part of the pleadings calvert argues that if this court should determine that the pleadings should be limited to the complaint then the motion to add calvert as party should be considered as part of the amended complaint because “the nexus between the two documents is so intimate that it was proper for the trial court to consider the two documents in when ruling ” finally calvert argues that if the trial court erroneously granted calvert’s rule 12 motion based upon the motion to add calvert then the trial court’s ruling should be upheld as rule 12 motion for judgment on the pleadings on this record we conclude that because the trial court considered evidence outside the pleadings calvert’s motion to dismiss should not have been granted and is reversed in ruling on motion to dismiss court properly may consider only evidence contained in or asserted in the pleadings see american angus corp 865 f supp w d n c 1993 state of tenn on behalf of tennessee dept of health and environment management of state of n c 78 n c app 763 765 338 s e 2d 781 782 1986 the motion to add calvert as party was not part of the pleadings and the statement in the motion that calvert was an excess insurer should not have been considered see howell shuford north carolina civil practice and procedure 7 5 4th ed 1992 motion is not considered pleading as indicated by the between rule regarding pleadings and rule regarding motions ” accordingly the court’s order dismissing the amended complaint pursuant to rule 12 was erroneous and is reversed based on our disposition of this issue we need not address the remaining issues raised on appeal reversed and remanded judges wynn and walker concur

Review: vaughn the only question on the appeal is whether plaintiff’s evidence taken in the light most favorable to him and giving to it the benefit of every reasonable inference which can be drawn therefrom was sufficient to withstand defendant’s motion for directed verdict we hold that it was the jury could reasonably have found among other things that plaintiff was struck by defendant’s car while he was crossing first street s w within an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection that defendant failed to keep proper lookout and failed to yield the right of way to plaintiff as required by law these and other permissible findings and inferences would support jury verdict for plaintiff wagoner butcher n c app 221 170 s e 2d 151 nor was the properly allowed on the ground that plaintiff was negligent as matter of law this would have been proper only if plaintiff’s evidence considered in the light most favorable to him so clearly established his own negligence as one of the proximate causes of his injuries that no other reasonable inference might be drawn therefrom bowen gardner 275 n c 363 168 s e 2d 47 carter murray n c app 171 171 s e 2d 810 even if defendant were correct in her contention that plaintiff’s evidence showed that plaintiff was crossing the street at an angle and not in an unmarked crosswalk at the intersection the ease would still have been one for the jury there was evidence from which the jury could find that defendant motorist failed to use due care to avoid colliding with the plaintiff pedestrian as required by law g s 20 174 failure to yield the right of way is not contributory negligence per se but rather it is evidence of negligence to be considered with other evidence in the case in determining whether the pedestrian is chargeable with negligence which proximately caused or contributed to his injury bank phillips 236 n c 470 73 s e 2d 323 reversed campbell and britt jj concur

Review: reade we are satisfied that the defendant thomas roberts administrator of william roberts contrived to have the lands of the estate sold by himself as administrator and commissioner to make the proceeds assets fraudulently for the purpose of buying the lands himself in his petition for the order of sale he the amount of the debts of the estate by nearly double and he the lands so as to conceal from the court their value there was really but 47 13 of debts to be paid and two of the tracts sold for 48 and there was no need to sell the home tract which brought 445 to pay few dollars cost of the order of sale two witnesses testify that he procured the home tract to be bid off for himself and he has been in the enjoyment of the rents and profits ever since the sale except probably for one year the evidence connecting deal the purchaser with the fraud of thomas roberts is satisfactory if he had contemplated buying tract of land for his own use it would probably have been the subject of conversation with his family but it evidently took them by surprise for when he went home from the sale his wife asked him who bought the land he answered that he bid it off ” what did you do it for said she he answered thomas roberts will take it off my hands ” and thomas roberts has ever since enjoyed the rents and profits we cannot suppose that deal bought it as an investment for it sold for more than its worth and it does not appear that he had any other inducement to buy as to keep off bad neighbors ” whereas it does appear that thomas roberts had such inducement the authorities cited in the brief of plaintiff’s counsel fully establish the doctrine that trustee cannot buy at his sale either by himself or by another indeed it is learning there are some qualifications of the general rule as where he does so without fraud and with the consent of the cestui que trust or their subsequent sanction pitt petway 12 ire 69 there is nothing in this case to take it out of the general rule and therefore the plaintiffs have the right to treat the sale as nullity and to have a re sale there is no error in the interlocutory order let this be per curiam decree affirmed

Review: brock the defendant assigns as error that the trial judge found that the affidavit for the search warrant and the search warrant were in conformity with the requirements of the law the affidavit for the search warrant and the search warrant appear to be complete and amply adequate to satisfy the requirements •of the law and the defendant makes no argument in his brief to the contrary defendant’s only argument under this assignment of error is addressed to the fact that an unexecuted copy of the affidavit and warrant were admitted in evidence in place of the original at the trial defendant made no objection to the copy being used instead of the original the defendant objected but specified that his was upon other grounds it appears clearly from the officer testimony that the original of the affidavit and the warrant were in the file of an accomplice who was separately tried also the officer who identified the copies was the same officer who actually executed the original of the affidavit and served the warrant and he was clearly in position to verify that the copies were true copies had the defendant objected to the copies being used the originals could have easily been secured from the accomplice’s file at that time it would not be proper to allow the defendant to raise this objection for the first time in this court defendant’s first assignment of error is overruled the defendant assigns as error that the trial judge allowed the officer who executed the affidavit for the search warrant and who served the search warrant to testify as to the fruits of the search the defendant argues that the search warrant was served on some unidentified person and therefore the search is not valid search the search warrant directed that the premises of lloyd phillips be searched the officer testified that he served the warrant on mr lloyd phillips at the address contained in the warrant and that he thereafter conducted the search of mr phillips’ premises which revealed quantity of items allegedly taken from the premises which had been broken into some of the items were found in defendant’s which was in mr phillips’ house defendant’s second assignment of error is without merit in the trial we find no error mallard c j and parker concur

Review: we have examined with care the errors assigned in the bill of exceptions both for venire de novo and for new trial without being able to find anything to sustain either of them the objection to the formation of the jury upon which the motion for venire de novo was founded is clearly untenable the challenge to the array of the original panel of jurors by the prisoner and the admission by the solicitor for the state of the cause of challenge made it absolutely necessary to resort to the special venire just as it would have been had the prisoner challenged each juror separately in the latter case the jurors summoned on the special have properly been called in and we cannot perceive any good reason why the same course was not admissible when the whole original panel was set aside at the instance of the prisoner state benton 196 state lytle ire 58 state shaw ire 532 the objection to the charge of the judge upon the motion for new trial was based is also untenable the instruction which the prisoner’s counsel requested to be given the jury upon the testimony of his witness dr sloan was that if they believed the circumstances of the homicide were correctly stated by the prisoner in his interview with the witness sloan and that the prisoner killed the deceased to save his own life he could not be convicted of murder but of manslaughter only the judge declined to give the instructions in the terms asked and we think he did so properly because it left out of view the material and important fact that the testimony of the witness tended to prove that the prisoner had followed the deceased with deadly weapon for the purpose of demanding satisfaction for the insult given him and to kill deceased or to do him great bodily harm should the demand for satisfaction be refused the judge therefore was right to his 428 charge to the facts proved and according to them the prisoner was undoubtedly guilty of murder see state madison johnson ire 354 as explained and corroborated in state jacob johnson jon 247 it must be certified to the superior court of law for the county of gaston that there is no error in the record per curiam there is no error

Review: denny we think the merit of this appeal depends on whether or not the defendant employed mr willis of the catawba bar to appear for him in the trial of this cause the defendant’s counsel mr david swift was absent with the permission of the court when the case was called for trial however he had requested continuance of all his cases for the reason heretofore set out the defendant submitted an affidavit in support of his motion to set aside the judgment herein in which he denies that he employed or mr willis to appear for him in this litigation moreover the record does not disclose finding by the court to the effect that mr willis was employed or requested to represent the defendant in the trial of this cause the record does state that the court proceeded upon the assumption that mr willis represented the defendant therefore if he was not authorized to represent the defendant in the trial of this case he was without authority to waive jury trial therein and to consent for the court to hear the evidence find the facts and declare the law arising thereon furthermore without the consent of the parties the court was without authority to dispense with jury trial and to hear the evidence find the facts and declare the law arising thereon and any judgment based thereon would be void mcintosh on practice and procedure 734 et seq ellis ellis 190 418 130 estes rash 170 341 87 109 the court was not requested to set aside the judgment in its discretion it was requested to set aside the judgment for irregularities in that mr willis was not employed by the defendant to represent him in the trial of this case upon the facts disclosed on this record we think mr willis acted in good faith in participating in the trial he was acting not only in the capacity of friend to the court but he was also endeavoring to accommodate fellow member of the local bar and unquestionably he interpreted what the defendant told him over the telephone to mean that he was employed to represent the defendant if the court ordered the case tried likewise the court acted in good faith in assuming that mr willis represented the defendant but his authority to appear in the case having been denied in the absence of finding to the contrary we think the motion to set aside the judgment should have been allowed as matter of law if the defendant had been present at the trial below and had not protested the appearance of mr willis in his behalf he would be estopped from denying his authority to appear in view of the conclusion reached herein there must be new trial and it is so ordered it is unnecessary to consider or discuss the remaining exceptions new trial

Review: beogden there is no new or novel proposition of law presented by tbe record tbe sole question is whether under tbe agreed facts tbe case is controlled by johnston garrett 190 835 130 835 or starkey gardner 194 74 138 408 this court has held “that tbe subdivisions of myers park are each separate distinct and integral development ” stephens co homes co 181 335 108 233 johnston garrett 190 835 when persons desiring to become home owners purchase property in subdivision protected by certain desirable restrictive covenants tbe security of such covenants ought not to be destroyed by slight the original plan and valid restrictions appearing in all the deeds for lots in such subdivision should not be eliminated and out because of immaterial violations of such restrictions one of the essential tests prescribed for determining whether restrictions should be eliminated was thus expressed in starkey gardner supra “however it is equally true that if the character of the community has been changed by the expansion of city and the spread of industry or other causes resulting in substantial subversion or fundamental change in the essential character of the property then in such cases equity will not rigidly enforce the restriction ” therefore the paramount question is whether the facts in the case at bar bring the controversy within the principle applied in the starkey case there is no fact tending to show any violation of the restriction within the subdivision itself except the fact that the owners of seven lots have signed releases in order to permit the owner of lot 13 to erect an art on said lot the nature of such building does not appear however we are of the opinion that the evidence does not show such “substantial subversion or fundamental change in the essential character of the property” as to warrant the removal of the restrictions reversed 
Original summary: deeds and conveyances held character of ment had not so changed as to warrant equity to declare restrictions inoperative restrictive covenants in deeds against the use of the property for other than residential purposes will not be strictly when the character of the surrounding land has been so substantially changed by the of the city as to make the enforcement of the restrictions inequitable and unjust but in this case held the facts found do not show such substantial change in the character of the neighborhood as to call for the operation of this equitable rule and the restrictions are enforceable and the fact that few of the owners of lots near the plaintiff’s property had released their rights to insist upon the observance of the restrictions and that the development was divided into separate is insufficient to change this result

Review: manly the objection made to the recovery in this case in the court below was the want of notice to the principal before bringing the action this objection is not tenable the general rule seems to be that where one person being under an obligation to do so pays money which another was primarily liable to pay an action accrues immediately for money paid the principal debtor is bound to keep in mind his liabilities and at the proper time to interpose between his surety and creditor for the protection of the former and if he fail to do so and the surety be required to pay it is not necessary to the completion of his legal rights of complaint that he should hunt up his principal and make demand we are not aware that this point has at any time been raised in our courts but similar actions are very numerous the absence from every case of any such point is of itself high evidence of what the law is in actions by surety against his principal notice to principal before suit is no where recognized as an element of the plaintiff’s case the cases are collated in the american edition of smith’s leading cases vol 228 and in greenleaf new hampshire rep 271 on the trial below the court in the absence of direct authority was led into error from supposed analogy between the relations of the parties and that which exists between co sureties such are the relations between co sureties that if and make himself the creditor of the others he ought in common justice to notify them of this change of relation before he sues for contribution but such is not the case as between principal and surety the nonsuit must be set aside and judgment rendered upon the verdict per curiam nonsuit set aside and judgment for plaintiff

Review: to ail indictment for an assault and battery tbe defendant plead not guilty and requested tlie court to charge the jury that as the state did not show or offer to show that the offence was committed within two years before the prosecution was instituted they must return verdict of not guilty the court refused so to charge and held that if the defendant relied upon the statute of limitations he must show it or give the state notice of it ” this was error the general issue not guilty made it incumbent upon the state to prove every thing necessary to establish the guilt of the defendant we believe practice has grown up under which the state does not usually in the trial of misdemeanors prove in the first instance venue time unless some point be made thereon by the defendant but this practice is permitted merely for convenience and the dispatch of business and ought never to prejudice defendant who as in this case relies upon such defences the court might have permitted the prosecution to recall witness and prove time place when the defendant asked for instructions to the jury but instead of so doing ruling was made to the prejudice of the defendant for which there must be venire de novo pek cueiam ire de novo

Review: ruffin the prisoner’s counsel seemed to be aware that the appeal could not be maintained upon the ground that no appeal will lie from an interlocutory judgment in action and without insisting thereon asked for rule upon the state to show cause why writ of certiorari should not issue relying upon the matter set out in the record as sufficient to support his motion we feel constrained both to dismiss the appeal and to deny the motion for certiorari the first for the reason above suggested that no appeal will lie in criminal action except from final judgment and the latter because the practice of this court is to grant writs of certiorari only when applied for by petition in due form setting forth the grounds of the application this it was said in case 66 309 is the regular and orderly mode of proceeding and that it should not be departed from except under peculiar circumstances but apart from any mere question of procedure we are of opinion that the requirements of the law as laid down in state honeycutt 74 391 and state 80 377 were all met and fully complied with in the care taken by his honor to make the record and declare his finding thereon seeing nothing in the case that can possibly constitute legal defence against the further prosecution of the prisoner we dismiss his appeal and overrule his motion for certiorari as to the suggestion that his honor found but the single fact of the inability of the jury to agree it is unsupported by the statement of the case as prepared by his honor he distinctly states that he found all the facts set out i n the record and that acting upon those facts as found he directed the mistrial and without any such express declaration it would be so understood from the very manner of making up the record per curiam appeal dismissed certiorari refused

Review: taylor chief justice all the defendants in this case claim the property under the null of their father except william who received tract of land by way of advancement as to which if the question had been undecided should have thought it was to be brought into hotchpot upon his claiming share of the personal estate but though did not concur in the decision of jones jones murph feel myself bound by it more especially as many estates have been divided according to it and the the law at this time would lead to much confusion on this ground and this alone am of opinion that the land claimed by william as given to him in the life time of his father is not the subject of distribution when claim is made for the personalty as the act of requires only that property to be brought into hotchpot which has been settled or advanced to the child in the life time of the parent it excludes all that which passes by will and all the children are consequently entitled to distributive share of the personal property of which william wilson the father died intestate and the judgment of the superior court must be as the words of the act of 1784 by which the descent of lands regulated are not restricted to an act in the life time of the parent different construction has been made in regard to the settlement of lands but respecting which arises in this case hall judge was one of the court that decided the case of jones jones mur 150 was in the minority but consider myself bound by that decision because many estates have been settled and are now held under it on that account in the present case the real and personal property cannot be together nor do think that legacies given by the testator’s will can be brought into the account under the law of distributions as it appears that there were no advancements made by the testator in his life time think division can only be made of such property as the testator has made no disposition of and as to which he died intestate let the judgment below be affirmed henderson judge concurred 
Original summary: land given to child by way of advancement shall not be brought into upon his claiming share of the personal estate legacies given by testator’s will cannot be brought into account in the distribution of personalty as to which he died intestate

Review: it will be perceived by reference to the will that the testator makes provision for widow and ten children three males and seven females in making disposition of his slaves he gives lot specifically his with remainder over he then gives specific legacy for the sole and separate of his daughter eliza wright of four slaves with limitation for life and remainder over the testator next directs that after the respective parcels allotted to his wife and daughter eliza shall have been taken out from the whole the residue shall be divided into nine parts three of which shall be the property of his three boys respectively and the other six be allotted to his daughters and these six lots are also secured for the sole and separate use of his said daughters it is obvious the testator intended to confine this last bequest to six daughters and it seems equally clear that the six were those for whom he had made no immediate provision in the previous part of his will it is not practicable to distribute six lots among seven persons and preserve the distinctive character of the lots and if the testator had intended to give eliza for whom he had just made provision share with the others of the residue he would have provided the requisite number of lots by consolidating and re dividing the construction contended for by eliza wright one of the legatees of the will is therefore manifestly erroneous and the true construction declared to be in accordance with the views aud action of the executrix that is to say the six remaining lots of the residue of the slaves should be distributed to the six daughters viz caroline charlotte margaret mary and henrietta and be held by the trustee named in the will for them in conformity with the trust created pee decree accordingly 
Original summary: where testator having seven daughters provided for one by name and then directed that the residue of his estate should be divided into nine equal parts three of which were to go to his three sons and the other six parts to be allotted to his daughters it was field that the meaning of the testator was that each of the six daughters remaining to be provided for should have one of the six remaining equal parts

Review: daniel judge after stating the case proceeded as follows in ordinary cases where party under sheriff he is compelled to produce judgment and execution against the debtor as well as the sheriff’s deed if the owner of the land was indebted for the taxes the lessor of the plaintiff had it in his power to shew that fact from the records of the court the law requires all persons to list with the justice their taxable property if an owner of land neglects to attend the justice and give in his list the justice is directed to appoint freeholder in the neighborhood to value the land on oath and the freeholder is to return the valuation to the justice who adds it to his list and returns it into the county court in case of the failure of the owner and the magistrate it then is the duty of the sheriff within the time prescribed for collecting the taxes to summon freeholder to value the land on oath fair transcript of valuation the freeholder is directed to send to the clerk of the county court before the next succeeding court and the clerk shall incorporate the return with those made by the justice and the freeholder is also to deliver to the sheriff another transcript of the same the tax lists thus returned are directed to be recorded by the clerk these records as it seems to us are in the nature of judgments against each individual on the lists for the sums respectively set against their names within thirty days after the court to which the lists are returned the clerk is to deliver copy of the lists to the sheriff and he is to collect the taxes due by distress and sale or otherwise the certified copies of the tax lists delivered by the clerk to the sheriff are in law his warrants of distress or executions gainst the property of each individual for the satisfaction of the money due on them — if there is no personal property to be found the sheriff is to the land and after advertising the same as the law directs and also performing the duties prescribed by the act of 1819 rev stat ch 102 sec 52 and 53 he will sell the same or so much thereof as shall be sufficient for the payment of the taxes due and the costs of the sale it seems to us therefore that until it be shewn by competent evidence that specific tax has been legally ascertained to be due the authority of the sheriff to sell for tax does not appear arid as his sale can operate to transfer title only by force of his authority unless that authority be shewn his deed passes no estate per curiam judgment affirmed 
Original summary: a sheriff deed for land sold for is not sufficient to deprive the owner of his land without shewing farther the authority of the sheriff to sell by proving that the taxes for which the sale was made were due 1

Review: beogden the two determinative questions of law presented by the record are what is the effect of the distress judgment rendered in west virginia in september 1926 do the letters written by the defendant prevent the bar of the statute of limitations the west virginia judgment upon its face is proceeding in rem in the nature of an attachment and was obtained without personal service upon the defendant such judgment “is conclusive evidence that the debt sued on was due to the plaintiff in it to the value of the property attached but of nothing more ” peebles guano co 77 233 warlick reynolds 151 606 66 657 johnson 166 104 81 1057 consequently the plaintiff’s suit cannot be maintained upon the judgment but must of necessity rest upon the debt as against the debt the defendant pleads the statute of limitations in actions of debt the statute of limitation of the forum govern flannery 198 397 151 857 obviously tbe three year statute of limitations bars the debt unless the letters set out in the record are sufficient to remove the bar and keep the debt alive 416 prescribes the statutory method of arresting the running of the statute the accepted principle of law was stated in phillips giles 175 409 95 772 as follows “in order to revive debt which is barred by the statute there should be an express unconditional promise to pay the same or that there should be definite unqualified acknowledgment of the debt as subsisting obligation and from which the law will imply promise to pay ” wells hill 118 900 24 771 irvin harris 182 647 109 867 manifestly the letter of 24 july 1926 even if it amounted to an express promise to pay the debt was ineffective on 23 may 1930 when the present suit was instituted moreover the letter of 19 december 1929 is not such an acknowledgment of subsisting obligation as the statute or decisions contemplate as sufficient and adequate to tear down the bar of limitation therefore the ruling of the trial judge was correct the court is not inadvertent to the fact that the action was instituted by smith as agent for moore but it is not deemed necessary to discuss this phase of the case affirmed

Review: daniel judge the court is called upon to put construction upon the residuary clause in the will of moore and also to decide upon the rights of the parties according to the facts admitted in the pleadings we are of the opinion that by fair interpretation of the said clause as stated in the bill and admitted in the answers the testatrix intended the residuum of her property should be divided into equal shares one share was to go to he two and one other share to the two and the three other shares to the three other named legatees viz godley nelson and forest this construction we think necessarily follows when we see the word the first conjunction placed immediately preceding the christian names of the two and the words to draw one share placed immediately following the names of the said two then comes the bequest to the two in these words also and nancy hardie to draw one share testatrix having directed of this fund to be allotted to some of the said residuary legatees the whole fund must necessarily be supposed to have been intended by the testatrix to be first equally divided into five shares and then two of these five shares to be again divided between the and this being so made the legatees take in shares mrs nelson one of the legatees having died before her mother the testatrix and having left son william nelson one share of the five will belong to him by virtue of the act of assembly rev stat ch 122 sec 15 john brinkley one of the two who was to have one share having died in the life time of the testatrix the question now is whether his moiety of one share survives to the other legatees or whether it lapses and goes to the next of kin of the testatrix we are of the opinion that all the residuary legatees whether taking whole shares or moiety of shares would have been if they had lived not joint tenants but tenants in common of the fund therefore the moiety of the one share bequeathed to the said john alexander brinkley lapsed and now belongs to the next of kin of the testatrix per curiam decree accordingly

Review: smith after stating the case we concur in the ruling that the several legacies must be paid in full to each according to the directions of the will if the fund is sufficient regardless of the supposed effect in producing inequality in their value the testator in explicit terms makes the apportionment and he declares that the sums thus given do in fact make and are so intended each living daughter and the representatives of the deceased daughters for whom provision is made equal with his other daughters in this distribution among them there is no rule of construction and no principle of law which authorise the court to do direct violence to the testator’s clear intentions in taking from what he has given one legatee and adding what he has given another upon supposed misconception the results ’the testator declares not only general purpose to be impartial in his bounty but that these several sums do produce equality among the this is the equality he intends and this division of the property must stand we cannot undertake to sa how far the excess in two of the shares may be due to the inferior value of the furniture and stock advanced to those daughters the testator may have considered that inequality in the money bequests to them the case cited in the plaintiffs’ brief is decisive of this view of the case freeman knight ired eq 72 there the testator gave his son in law and wife “ 2 700 and adding six hundred and seventy six dollars of the money and notes in this item have been paid to him balance due four dollars to be paid to him at my death ” the actual difference between the full legacy and the sum al ready received was but 24 but it was held the sum declared te be the balance 84 must be paid but we are unable to accept the interpretation that the excess in the hands of the executor must be first paid to the legacies of apparent inferior value until they reach those at higher value before they can share in the fund the testator has already established what he considers to be an absolute equality among them and upon this basis he requires any surplus the executor may have after meeting the money legacies to be distributed equally among the to whom property has been left plainly intending to add to each share a n equal portion of such surplus while the latter point is not strictly embraced in the case it has been considered and passed on by the court and has been argued by counsel on either side before us and we intimate our opinion to avoid the inference that the ruling is approved error reversed

Review: daniel judge after stating the facts as above set forth proceeded there has been great deal of testimony taken in this cause we have examined it and are satisfied that the judgment in favour of the plaintiff against stephen clements as mentioned in the bill was truly the property of the plaintiff and that it had been placed in the hands of john carrington as agent of the plaintiff to be sent to the state of tennessee for collection the defendant by his admissions had sufficient evidence before him to put him upon inquiry if he had in fact advanced or paid at the time valuable consideration for the judgment but we are of the opinion that he does not come within the principles of the rule as he in fact was nothing out of pocket by the assignment so far as relates to this judgment the inducement for the assignment was old debts due by carrington to him and already incurred liabilities but no acquittance was given for the same to carrington there was no present loss to the defendant in consequence of the assignment the defendant admits that he received the judgment or notes which were given for it the evidence proves that he was compelled to receive this debt and others in horses and as just loss on the claims we are of the opinion as carrington is that the plaintiff is entitled to decree for an account of so much of the judgment as the defendant has actually received it is therefore referred to the master of the court of equity for the county of orange as commissioner to state and report what sum in cash value the defendant horner has received on the said judgment allowing him reasonable commissions for his trouble in collecting that sum per curiam decree accordingly

Review: faircloth after stating the case as above the plaintiff claims title on the theory that the homestead was not in his way this is the pivotal point in the case on the closest inspection of the record we are unable to ascertain when the debt for which the judgment was rendered was contracted or how or for what it was contracted the first and only evidence of the existence of this debt is the judgment rendered in 1869 we must therefore assume this to be the date of the beginning of the debt 333 we can not presume its existence at any prior time this being so the homestead guaranteed by the constitution of 1868 is valid as against the plaintiff’s judgment and being regularly assigned at the instance of the defendant it was not the subject of sale under the plaintiff’s execution and he acquired no title by the sheriff’s sale he did not even get the reversionary interest because that could not be sold under an execution until after the termination of the homestead interest itself bat rev ch 55 26 again the question is affected by the proceedings bankruptcy the assignee set apart the same premises to the bankrupt as his homestead and although this was after had sold to the defendant this fact can not help the plaintiff if by this assignment in any view floyd acquired any interest of course it was protected by the provisions of the bankrupt act and if the defendant’s title was not already complete this newly acquired estate would have fed the estoppel between floyd and the defendant which coupled with defendant’s purchase of the reversionary interest made his good title to the absolute estate the homestead being valid according to our state laws it is expressly secured and protected against any and all liens or incumbrances by revised statutes the plaintiff’s deed ordered by his honor tobe surrendered for cancellation is not found in the record and we can not say whether it is valuable for any other purpose to him or not but its cancellation is not essential or important to the defendant’s rights and that portion of the order is reversed and with this modification the judgment below is affirmed the defendant will recover costs in this court and the action be dismissed pee curiam judgment modified and affirmed

Review: j the case on appeal which was made up by appellant’s counsel no counter case having been filed by the solicitor recites that the defendant appealed to this court “in forma pauperis upon filing an affidavit that he is unable to give security for the costs of the appeal ” this is almost identical with the language used in state jones 93 617 it is there intimated that possibly if the recital had been simply that the defendant was permitted by the court to appeal in forma pauperis upon affidavit filed there would be presumption that the affidavit was sufficient but where as in that case and in this the substance of the affidavit is set out and the court sees that it is insufficient the appeal must be dismissed an appeal in forma pauperis is only permissible when the statutory requirements have been complied with state wylde 110 500 and cases there cited the granting of the motion of the attorney general to dismiss is not matter of discretion but right state morgan 77 510 state payne 93 612 since this cause was argued and decided and the opinion written the defendant sends up copy of the affidavit on which the leave to appeal was granted no motion or order for certiorari was made and we cannot recognize this irregular mode of sending up papers after cause is heard without notice to the other side and without an order of the court such papers become no part of the record notice was reiterated at last term in the case of state frizell 111 722 that if there were defects in making up cases or transcripts on appeal the court would not grant certiorari to appellants to correct the same unless it was shown that the appellant was without default fortiori the court will not permit such correction and amendment to be made by the party himself without certiorari granted is true that in an exceptional case the court might permit the certiorari to issue now or might send it down ex mero motu but an examination of the record shows technical not substantial grounds of exception to the proceedings below the rulings and judgment of that court are presumed to be correct the case on appeal as made out by the appellant entitled the attorney general to have his motion to dismiss granted the appellant neither applied for certiorari when the case was reached nor has the court thought the case one requiring it to issue such writ ex mero appeal dismissed 
Original summary: appeal in forma insufficient affidavit dismissal correction of case on appeal an appeal in forma pauperis is only permissible when the statutory requirements have been complied with where the substance only of the affidavit for leave to appeal pauperis is set out in the case on appeal and the court sees that it is insufficient the appeal will be dismissed on motion of the appellee not as matter of discretion but of right an amendment or correction to case or transcript on appeal cannot be made by party himself without certiorari granted while the court may in matters of concern permit certiorari to issue on motion of party without notice to the other side or e r mero it this will not be done where the record shows only technical and not substantial grounds of exception to the proceedings below

Review: per curiam the defendant objected to parol testimony of possession of the land in controversy by the plaintiff on the ground that it contradicted the will it will be observed however that there was evidence tending to show that the parties were put in possession of their respective interests in said land by elijah lewis the father in 1882 and that the plaintiff therefore claims title under said oral partition and continuous adverse possession of said premises since said time “a parol partition of land is not void but merely voidable and any evidence is admissible which tends to show either ratification of the partition or conduct from which the parties seeking to disregard it are held to be estopped in so doing ” collier paper corporation 172 74 if parol partition is made between tenants in common and they severally take possession each of his or her part so allotted and continue in the sole and exclusive possession since the allotment for period of twenty years without the assertion of any claims or demands for rents issues or benefits by any of said tenants upon the others but each recognizing the other’s possession to be of right and hostile the law will presume an actual ouster and supervening adverse possession craig 141 602 under such circumstances parol evidence is permissible to show the facts constituting the possession manner of acquiring it and the length of time the possession has existed the defendant further excepts to letter which was written by him to his brother the plaintiff in this action on 13 september 1920 in this letter was the following statement “you know that you have always had the privilege of it the land in controversy to suit yourself ” the defendant contends that the letter was an offer of compromise we do not so interpret it but even if it was an offer of compromise the statement in the letter referred to is the distinct admission of an independent fact recognizing the possession of the plaintiff and this independent fact is competent harris 160 307 montgomery lewis 187 577 there was sufficient evidence upon the question to be submitted to the jury the entire charge of the court is not in the record and it must therefore be assumed that it was correct upon the question of possession and the effect of the will no error

Review: allen there is no exception to tbe refusal to set aside tbe judgment by default and inquiry nor is tbe legal effect of tbe provision tbe action to be brought witbin six months before us as the bill of lading was only admitted in evidence on the issue of damages the sole question presented is whether the judgment by default and inquiry prevents the defendant from relying upon the provision in the contract the effect of judgment by default and inquiry is to establish the cause of action alleged in the complaint and if the recovery sought is damages to give to the plaintiff the right to recover at least nominal damages and no evidence is admissible tending to prove that no right of action exists in telephone co 172 714 where there were two parties defendant one of whom answered and the other of whom failed to answer judgment by default and inquiry was rendered against the defendant who failed to answer in discussing the question involved the court says “he failed to plead and judgment by default was entered against him which established as against him under our procedure and procedure generally the cause of action alleged in the complaint blow joyner 156 140 graves cameron 161 549 patrick dunn 162 19 plumbing co hotel co 168 577 it was not necessary to submit an issue as to this negligence when he admitted it by failing to answer justice brown well says in plumbing co hotel co supra ‘the default is an admission of every material and traversable allegation of the declaration or complaint necessary to the plaintiff’s cause of action 23 cyc 752 it admits all the material averments properly set forth in the complaint and of course everything essential to establish the right of the plaintiff to recover any testimony therefore tending to prove that no right of action existed or denying the cause of action is irrelevant and inadmissible citing dollar 49 176 lee knapp 90 171 blow joyner supra graves cameron supra this being so the only thing left to do in regard to the resident defendant was the assessment of damages after ascertaining the negligence of the other defendant ” this authority covers fully the exception presented and sustains the ruling that the provision of the bill of lading was inadmissible to destroy the plaintiff’s action no error

Review: ashe there were five grounds assigned for quashing the indictment only one of which we think is worthy of the consideration of this court and that is the second which assigns the want of certainty in the description of the property obtained as fatal defect in the indictment we hold this objection is well taken the bill is informally and loosely drawn and we think the allegation that the defendant obtained goods and money from henderson pritchard and john pritchard is too vague and uncertain as general rule the same degree of certainty in the description of the goods obtained in indictments for obtaining goods under false pretences is required as in the description of goods alleged to be stolen in larceny the goods should have been described specifically by the names usually appropriated to them and the money obtained should have been described at least by the amount as for instance so dollars and cents an indictment before 1877 for stealing without further description could not have been sustained and the legislature to remedy the difficulty of describing and identifying bank bills treasury notes which may be stolen passed the act of 1876 77 ch 68 providing that in indictments in such cases it shall be sufficient to describe such money treasury note or bank bill simply as money ” there are cases where indictments have been sustained for obtaining by false pretences so many dollars say eighty dollars of the moneys of and if this indictment had been so drawn we would have sustained notwithstanding its form in other respects but we think the term without anything added to make it more definite is too loose in indictments of this kind there is error in the ruling of the superior court the judgment of that court is reversed let this be certified to the superior court of bertie county to the end that further proceedings may be had in conformity to this opinion and the law error reversed

Review: dick by the common law it was the duty of sheriff to do execution of all the writs without any reward the fees and emoluments of sheriff and the manner in which they are to he paid are regulated by statute but many of the rules which define his powers duties and liabilities áre derived from the common law before the adoption of the a sheriff as an officer of the law was bound to execute the process of the courts according to the exigency thereof and make due return and he could not refuse to execute writ until his fees were paid salk 333 strange 814 under the sec 75 555 he is not required to execute process until his fees are paid or tendered by the person at whose instance the service is to be rendered but this does not excuse him for failure return of process writ of summons is mandate of the court aud must be obeyed by its officer and if he has any valid excuse for not executing the writ he must state such matter of excuse in his return watson on sheriffs 73 the duties and liabilities of sheriff in relation to the execution of process are nearly the same under the as under the old system 354 but the mode of procedure for enforcing judgment nisi is changed from scire facias to civil action sec 362 when this point was before this court in the case of thompson berry 64 79 the line of distinction between civil actions and special proceedings was not clearly defined as was done afterwards in the case of tate powe 64 644 scire facias is writ founded upon some matter of record in general it is judicial writ issuing out of the court where the record is made and as the defendant may it is considered in law as an action and in the nature of new original sand note 71 note tidd there are many forms of this writ found in the register of original writs bac ab 598 as the record of the judgment nisi was made in term time by the judge the process to make the judgment absolute ought to be returned before the same jurisdiction in the present case if sci fa could be used it would be in the nature of an original writ where it was used to revive final judgment it was only continuation of the original action and was returnable into the court where such action was pending in this case the action was properly brought to the court in term as it comes within the line marked out in tate powe supra the evidence shows that the process was delivered to the defendant in due time but without his lawful fees and there was no service or return of the writ the instructions of his honor were correct in law and the judgment must be affirmed judgment affirmed pee 
Original summary: under the sec 75 and sheriff is not required to execute process until his fees paid or tendered by the person at whose instance the service is to be rendered but this does not excuse him for failure to make return of the process writ of summons is mandate of the oourt and must be by its officer and if he has any valid excuse for not executing the writ he must state it in his return the duties and liabilities of sheriff in relation to the execution of process are nearly the same under the as under the old system see sec 354 but the mode of for enforcing judgment nisi against him is changed from scire facias to civil action as prescribed in sec 362 and the summons must be in the same oourt as the judgment and must be returned to the regular term thereof the case of thompson 79 cited and upon and that of ibid 644 cited and approved

Review: mitchell justice the question dispositive of this appeal is whether the state’s evidence was sufficient to permit rational trier of fact to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant broke into ms johnson’s house with the intent to commit the felony of rape therein the only evidence relevant to the element of intent was circumstantial the mode of dress of the defendant the evidence that the defendant was wearing knee length cast and shoe is too ambiguous standing alone to do more than raise possibility or conjecture that the defendant had the intent to commit rape as charged in the bill of indictment thus it was an insufficient foundation upon which to permit trier of fact to infer that he intended to commit the felony of rape once he broke into the house see state gaskins 252 n c 46 112 s e 2d 745 1960 ordinarily evidence of an unexplained breaking and entering into dwelling house in the nighttime is in itself “sufficient to sustain verdict that the breaking and entering was done with the intent to commit larceny rather than some other felony the fundamental theory in the absence of evidence of other intent or explanation for breaking and entering is that the usual object or purpose of dwelling house at night is theft ” state hedrick 289 n c 232 236 221 s e 2d 350 353 1976 state 277 n c 65 175 s e 2d 583 1970 the state chose to indict the defendant for breaking and entering with the intent to commit rape rather than larceny therefore the state became obligated to prove the specific felonious intent to commit rape as alleged state wilson 293 n c 47 235 s e 2d 219 1977 the state having failed to carry the burden the defendant’s burglary conviction must be reversed the intent to commit felony following breaking and entering distinguishes burglary from the lesser included offense of misdemeanor breaking and entering prohibited by g s 14 54 when the jury found the defendant guilty of burglary it found facts which would support conviction of misdemeanor breaking and entering the defendant’s counsel conceded as much during oral argument therefore because there is not sufficient evidence of intent to commit the felony of rape within ms johnson’s house we recognize the jury’s verdict as verdict of guilty of misdemeanor breaking and entering under g s 14 54 see state barnette 304 n c 447 284 s e 2d 298 1981 state jolly 297 n c 121 254 s e 2d 1979 the judgment upon the verdict of first degree burglary is vacated and the cause remanded to the superior court of guilford county for imposition of judgment as upon verdict of guilty of misdemeanor breaking and entering remanded for judgment as for verdict of guilty of misdemeanor breaking and entering 
Original summary: burglary and unlawful breakings 5 11— insufficient evidence of intent to rape as alleged verdict treated as for misdemeanor the evidence in first degree burglary case was insufficient to permit the jury to infer that defendant broke into the victim’s house with the intent to commit the felony of rape therein as charged in the indictment where the only evidence relevant to intent tended to show that defendant was wearing knee length cast and however when the jury found defendant guilty of burglary it necessarily found facts which would support conviction of misdemeanor breaking and entering and the verdict will be treated as verdict of guilty of misdemeanor breaking and entering

Review: the charge in the indictment is that of assault with the intent to commit rape the defendant however was only convicted of simple assault no deadly weapon was used nor was any serious damage done to the prosecutrix so that the offence committed was one within the jurisdiction of justice of the peace and the offender might have been prosecuted in that jurisdiction as however the indictment charged an offence in its nature embracing an assault within the jurisdiction of the criminal court that court obtained jurisdiction and although the conviction was for the less offence the court being one having general jurisdiction of criminal offences retained jurisdiction over the less offence and had authority to proceed to judgment in that respect the verdict of guilty of the less offence did not have the effect to oust the jurisdiction of the court state reaves 85 553 state ray 89 581 state speller 91 526 the court therefore had jurisdiction but we think there is error in the judgment because a the jury in effect found that there was no intent to commit rape the offence was not aggravated by the existence of such fact and because it appeared that no deadly weapon was used and no serious damage was done and further that the defendant was boy under fourteen years of age the statute the code expressly provides that in such cases the punishment should not exceed fine of fifty dollars or imprisonment for thirty days it should be observed that the defendant was only convicted of simple assault unattended by the distinguishing cause of aggravation mentioned the statute just cited is general and applies in such cases in all jurisdictions this case is different in respect to the manner of punishment from that of state watts 85 517 the judgment is that the defendant shall be imprisoned for twelve months “and that he be hired out by the county commissioners ” this order seems to have been made inadvertently is not the province of the court to direct that the defendant be out but to authorize the commissioners to do so under rules and regulations to be prescribed by them the code state norwood 93 578 there is therefore error the defendant is not entitled to new trial but to have such judgment as the law allows entered against him to that end let this opinion he certified to the criminal court according to law it is so ordered modified 
Original summary: jurisdiction punishment simple assault in which no deadly weapon is used and no serious bodily harm done to the prosecutor is within the jurisdiction o£ justice of the peace where an indictment charges an offence of which the superior court has jurisdiction but the conviction is for less offence the superior court having once obtained jurisdiction can proceed to judgment for such less offence in convictions for simple assaults where there is no intent to commit rape and no deadly weapon used and no serious bodily harm done the punishment is limited to fine of or imprisonment for thirty days the court has no power by its judgment to direct that the defendant shall be hired out by the county authorities but it can only authorize this to be done under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the commissioners so where defendant was indicted for an assault with an intent to commit rape and agreed to verdict for simple assault it was held that the superior court bad jurisdiction to pass sentence but that it could not for twelve months and order the county commissioners to hire the prisoner out in such ease the prisoner is not entitled to new trial but only that the case be remanded iu order that proper judgment may be passed state 85 553 state ray 89 581 state 91 state 85 517 state 93 578 cited and approved

Review: manly the case made by the transcript from the superior court of caldwell is whether planter who has not fence as required by law about his cultivated field nor any navigable or deep water serve instead thereof can recover for trespass of the defendant’s domestic animals on field thus unprotected we answer with the court below that he cannot maintain liability of the kind it would be necessary to hold that the proprietors of such animals are bound to keep them under restraint and prevent them from going and on the grounds of neighbor eor we take it the rights and liabilities of the parties would be the same in case where there is no fence or barrier and one in which the barrier is declared by law to be insufficient at the term of tins court which has j closed its session at the city of raleigh we held incidentally in the case of laws north carolina rail road company ante 468 that proprietor of cattle is not obliged to keep them from the unenclosed lands of neighbor the going at large of all kinds of domestic animals upon lands about them seems to be matter commonly tolerated by the laws and usages of the country the law makes it penal to kill animals trespassing upon cultivated field that is not lawfully enclosed and also indictable to kill them in the range in certain localities from which it would appear that they are not without the of the law’s protection when in these conditions and although they may be trespassers having no right of pasture outside of the owner’s lands and therefore may be driven and kept off if possible yet to effect these objects it is not lawful to kill or abuse in short the law in variety of ways the going at large of domestic animals as common privilege and it would seem to follow as necessary consequence that the owner is not liable in trespass for breaking the close when the cattle in search of food upon the latter’s grounds thus the keeping under inclosure domestic animals which is regarded as the rule of the common law of england if it were ever recognised in our waste and country has been long since abrogated by various legislative acts and by constant usage to the contrary the stream between the parties to this suit by the statement of the case appears to be insufficient as substitute for fence and we have already said it is the same whether there be no fence or an insufficient one we are of opinion therefore in the case before us neither proprietor would be liable to the other for damage done by animals of the one across the common boundary upon the lands of the other per ouriam judgment affirmed 
Original summary: a who has not fence as required by law about his cultivated field nor any navigable or deep water to serve instead thereof is not entitled to recover for trespass committed by domestic animals on field thus

Review: j under the view which we have taken of this case it is unnecessary to pass upon the alleged inconsistencies in the findings of the jury and all of the objections urged against the rulings of his honor in view of the findings upon the second and sixth issues it was necessary for the plaintiff to have the fourth issue in his favor and to this end he was permitted against the objection of the defendants for the purpose of showing negligence by running the at an excessive speed to prove that after the accident the defendants substituted another made of and that they ran this at much rate of speed in morse st co 11 am eng cases 168 the court after remarking that such evidence had been admitted by them in some previous cases deliberately overruled such former decisions the court say that it forms no basis for construing such act as an admission of previous neglect of duty person may have exercised all the care which law required and yet in the light of his new experience after an unexpected accident has occurred and as measure of extreme caution he may adopt additional safeguards the more careful person is the more regard he has for the lives of others the more likely he would be to do so and it would seem unjust that he could not do so without being liable to have such acts construed as an admission of prior negligence we think such rule puts an unfair interpretation upon human conduct and virtually holds out an inducement for continued negligence ” transportation co 56 sewell city of 11 626 baird daily 68 547 while we do not say that there ma r not be peculiar cases in which such testimony may he relevant we are entirely satisfied with the above reasoning as applicable to the facts of the present case the testimony was improper and probably had very important influence with the jury in making up their verdict error

Review: morris judge plaintiff james taylor presented the only evidence offered for he identified plaintiffs’ exhibit no as the deed to his property and testified that “it accurately describes my property ” he then testified that he knew the boundaries that an iron stake at each corner marks the boundaries he pointed to drawing on the and testified “i made the marks that are on the now this is carraway this here is state road 1832 an iron stake at this point this point this point and this point and also this corner at the time bought my property in july 1969 iron stakes were at this point this point this point this point this point and at this point right here my property was 220 feet wide on the road side the depth of my property on the northern line was 700 feet ” the witness later testified that he bought the property in july 1968 copy of the deed sent up as an exhibit is dated 15 july 1968 so we assume that 1968 is the correct date defendant contends this is not sufficient we agree in andrews bruton 242 n c 93 86 s e 2d 786 1955 an action for damages for trespass and cutting timber bobbitt now c j speaking for the court said “it seems appropriate to call attention to certain well established rules their allegations as to title having been denied it was incumbent upon plaintiffs to establish both ownership and trespass norman williams 241 n c 732 86 s e 2d 593 and cases cited whether relying upon their deeds as proof of title or of color of title they were required to locate the land by fitting the description in the deeds to the surface g s 8 39 locklear oxendine 233 n c 710 65 s e 2d 673 parsons lumber co 214 n c 459 199 s e 626 in the absence of title or color of title they were required to establish the known and visible lines and boundaries of the land actually occupied for the statutory period carswell morganton 236 n c 375 72 s e 2d 748 ” here also defendant denied plaintiffs’ title applying the well established rules set out in andrews bruton supra it is obvious that plaintiffs’ evidence is insufficient affirmed judges brock and vaughn concur

Review: winborne upon the record on this appeal the appellants contend stressfully and we think with propriety that each of them was prejudiced by the denial of their motions for separate trials while at the time the motions were made and overruled it doubtless did not appear that the state in order to connect defendants with alleged murder of ira godwin relied upon alleged confessions separately made by the defendants which would be competent as evidence only against the defendant making the confession and incompetent as evidence against any codefendant who was not present at the time the alleged confession was made and who did not by word or conduct acquiesce therein however in view of the fact that in each of the alleged confessions incriminating statements were made against other defendants we are unable to conclude that such incriminating statements were not prejudicial to such when it became apparent that the state relied solely upon such confessions for the conviction of the defendants as stated in cotton 218 577 12 2d 246 “without questioning the power of the court to consolidate cases for trial in proper instances and in discretionary authority ordinarily to deal with an application for severance it would seem that mistrial and severance at the close of all the evidence would have been in order ” as the ease goes back for new trial and as the record on appeal does not disclose in full the evidence upon which the court ruled as to competency of the alleged confessions we make no decision thereon however we call attention to the case of anderson 208 771 182 643 and cases therein cited as well as other decisions on the subject also as there is to be new trial we deem it unnecessary to deal with exception to form of judgment new trial

Review: tbe main question on tbis appeal to which nearly all the exceptions are directed is the constitutionality of chapter 243 of the acts of 1889 amending section of the code this act was held to be unconstitutional in parish cedar co 133 478 and after renewed consideration we deem it our duty to reaffirm our to that effect this destroys the defendant’s chain of title but does not necessarily perfect that of the plaintiff or render the defendant liable for trespass the plaintiff brought civil action in the nature of trespass alleging its ownership of the land in question and the defendant’s trespass thereon the jury found in substance that the plaintiff owned part of the lands described in the complaint but that the defendant had not trespassed upon those particular lands this was the practical result of the verdict and its legal effect was to entitle the defendant to judgment that it go without day and recover its costs incurred in the action we do not think that any judgment should have been given deciding the title to the land as that was not the essential question involved in the action trespass is essentially an offense against the possession and an action therefor can be maintained by one not holding the fee on the contrary it makes no difference who owns the fee if the defendant has committed no trespass thereon if both issues had been found in favor of the plaintiff it may be that he would have been entitled to judgment on his title as necessary requisite to his recovery but as he is not entitled to recovery simple judgment for the defendant should have been entered the judgment of the court below will be modified by striking out that part decreeing the plaintiff to be the owner of the lands therein described and then affirmed modified and affirmed

Review: brock chief judge defendant argues that the trial judge instructed the jury that defendant had the burden of proving that he acted in self defense defendant cites mullaney wilbur 421 u s 684 95 s ct 1881 44 l ed 2d 508 1975 in our view the principles of mullaney have no application to the instructions in the case now before us it has long been the rule in north carolina that defendant in cases not involving homicide does not have the burden of satisfying the jury that he acted in self defense trial judge clearly and unequivocally instructed the jury at least seven times during the charge that the burden of proof was upon the state to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of defendant at no point was burden of proving anything placed upon the defendant after explaining defendant’s right to act in self defense the trial judge instructed “now if you find that the defendant properly acted in self defense and are satisfied to sic this members of the jury then he would not be guilty of any offense he would not be guilty of the first issue or any lesser included offense ladies and gentlemen ” later in the charge the trial judge instructed “if you fail to so find or if you have reasonable doubt as to one or more of the essential elements of this lesser offense you should find the defendant not guilty and your verdict on the second issue would be not guilty or if you believe that he acted in self defense as the court has instructed you thereon members of the jury then you would find him not guilty of any offense ladies and gentlemen if you find that he properly acted in self defense on the occasion in question ” defendant’s argument is that the foregoing instructions placed upon defendant the burden of proving that he acted in self defense we do not agree the burden of proof of each element of the offense having been squarely placed upon the state we do not that the foregoing instructions could have conveyed to the jury an impression that defendant was required to prove anything defendant’s remaining assignment of error relates to the admission of evidence we have carefully reviewed this in the light of all the evidence and conclude that no prejudicial error has been shown no error judges britt and morris concur 
Original summary: assault and battery 15 instructions as to burden of proof no error in prosecution for assault with deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury the trial court’s instructions did not place upon the defendant the burden of proving that he acted in self defense but placed upon the state the burden of proof of each element of the offense

Review: per curiam the warrant on which the defendant was tried in the superior court pursuant to his appeal from conviction in the recorder’s court contained two counts charging possession of nontaxpaid whiskey for the purpose of sale and sale of one pint of nontaxpaid whiskey there was verdict of guilty on both counts and judgment was pronounced imposing concurrent prison sentences of 12 months on the first count and 18 months on the second count the defendant noted exception to the court’s charge to the jury on the first count and contended on the argument here that the expressions by the court to which he excepted tended to prejudice his cause without conceding error we deem it unnecessary to discuss the question as we note that on the verdict of guilty on both counts the court imposed concurrent prison sentences on the two counts hence it would seem no harm has resulted to the defendant of which he can justly complain no error johnson took no part in the consideration or decision of this case the foregoing opinion was prepared by devin emergency justice while he was sitting in place of johnson who was absent on account of his physical condition it is now adopted by the court and ordered filed

Review: bynum the application for relief under the provisions of § 133 is addressed to the discretion of the judge presiding below his action is not the subject of review here unless it plainly appears that he has abused the legal discretion vested in him nothing of the kind is shown in this case the affidavit of the defendant foote is not sustained by the facts as found by the court on the contrary it appears that foote accepted the service of the summons and waived all irregularities in the service and acted accordingly it is true he did not appear and defend at the return term but he knew and acted upon the fact that it was necessary and required for he had an interview with his co defendant in which he left the management of the case to cook it does not appear that either cook or foote had meritorious defence to the action therefore cook made the best terms he could with the plaintiff and allowed judgment to be taken upon certain terms of indulgence in enforcing its collection he doubtless deemed that the most prudent and beneficial course in the interest of and his co defendant the only defence foote now alleges to recovery is usury but that is certainly not meritorious defence and deprived of all significance by the action of the judge who reformed the judgment by striking from it all the interest which was alleged to be usurious that the principal money was borrowed of the plaintiff is not denied and all that the judgment has rendered for is the debt with legal interest had the right to appear at the return term and put in the plea of usury and make the plain tiff take the consequence of his making the plea good upon the trial instead of this he entrusted the case to an agent his co defendant without any instructions as to the defence the agent acted within the scope of his powers and even had he not done so the defendant must have shown some injury he has received or some meritorious defence of which he has been deprived he has not alleged either there is no error per curiam judgment affirmed

Review: clark j the code sec 590 is analyzed in bunn todd 107 266 the witness pender is party to the action and is also in the event of the action he is offered as witness to testify in his own behalf or interest and as to personal transaction or communication between the witness and person since deceased to prove partnership and further that the deceased partner specially authorized him to borrow this money the only possible debate is on the second head above stated whether the evidence given by the witness would be in his own interest ” strictly it would be “in the of plaintiff who called him as witness but the statute contains the words “in his own behalf or interest ” the true test of interest is whether the judgment obtained herein could be used as conclusive of the liability of the intestate’s estate in an action after wards brought by the witness against the administrator of the deceased jones emry 115 158 if by the testimony of the witness judgment is obtained not only against himself which is not opposed but also against his co defendant who is the administratrix of one sought to be charged as his partner then the witness upon paying off such judgment could proceed to recover the pro rata share out of his co defendants and this judgment obtained against the two being conclusive in each action of the would bind the said administratrix to contribution thus the testimony of the witness would be “in his own interest and is forbidden by the statute if the action was between the alleged partners the testimony of the witness the alleged surviving partner would be incompetent to prove the partnership sikes parker 95 232 armfield 103 147 this case differs widely from walters sutton at this term in that case the witness was the principal in the bond sued on against whom judgment was taken and he testified as toa personal communication between himself and his deceased surety but this was not in the interest of the witness liability was primary and who could in no wise be benefited nor could the judgment against him be in any wise abated by the judgment obtained upon his testimony against the surety this case if the witness’ testimony establishes the partnership the witness upon paying off the judgment can recover his pro rata share out of his co defendant’s estate since the judgment would establish that the debt was due by both as partners as co principals in excluding the testimony was no error no error

Review: smith after stating the facts we are unable to see any just ground for exceptions to the charge as to what constitutes due diligence under the circumstances and what falls short of it how more explicit could it be than in the enumeration of the facts testified to and upon which the measure of defendant’s duty was dependent the expression thoroughly canvassed in the instructions series of active and efforts to make sale of the and must necessarily be general it cannot be that it should mention them in detail when the evidence was before the jury of the acts in which the consists the court does declare the law upon the hypothesis of the acceptance of the facts in one and another aspect of the evidence and in our opinion quite as favorably to the plaintiffs as they could ask it is not always practicable to so separate the facts as to raise question of law for the court for they are often and must be passed on by the jury under appropriate directions of the court taking the alternative instructions which upon one statement of the facts show the exercise of due diligence and upon the other want of it and leaving to the jury to determine what upon the evidence were those facts to which the instruction is applicable the court has done all required for the rendering of an intelligent verdict the second exception to the charge that the jury did not properly respond to the second part of the instructions or in other words to give due weight to the evidence tending to show the absence of due diligence is addressed to the discretion of the judge in an application to set the verdict aside and cannot be entertained in this court we discover no error in the charge nor in admitting the contract out of which the defence arises in evidence indeed this last exception was not urged in the argument and we suppose was not relied on by the appellants the judgment must be affirmed no error affirmed
