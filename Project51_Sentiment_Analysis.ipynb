    "### Performance Evaluation\n",
    "After generating summaries using a number of different methods, one thing that is crucial to any Machine Learning task is performance evaluation, i.e. generating a numerical score that is indicative of how well the model is doing at it's given task. Several methods exist to evaluate text output. However, there is no 'standard' when it comes to a performance test. \n",
    "\n",
    "The need for a meaningful score is essential for any machine learning system for many reasons, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare different models\n",
    "* Evaluate the increase/decrease in perfromance when a change is implemented in our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### BLEU\n",
    "One of the most commonly used tests is the *BLEU* (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is commongly used for evaluating sequence to sequence tasks. However, it does not do well as an evalautor when applied to tasks that it was never intended to evaluate. Among BLEU's drawbacks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It does not consider meaning\n",
    "* It doesn not consider sentence structure\n",
    "* It doesn't map well to human Judgements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "Taking into account the drawbacks that exist for BLEU, We decided to opt for sentiment analysis as a perfomance metric. Though not a widely used evalation metric, it seems intuitive that a generated text should be a *true* representation of the original text in terms of essence, i.e. polarity and subjectivity. In other words, the gist of the original text should be represented in the generated summary. Moreover, considering the different models in this project having a model which enables us to compare the different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several libraries exist that are capable of performing senetence analysis, for our task we opted to go for TextBlob's sentiment feature. Which gives a score of (-1, 1) for polarity and (0, 1) for subjectivity. After generating a score for both the original text and generated summary we compute the *MSE*, to measure the deviation of the generated scores from the actual scores.\n",
